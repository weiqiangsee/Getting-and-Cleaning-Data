The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.  

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project: 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Good luck!

About the raw data

The features (561 of them) are unlabeled and can be found in the x_test.txt. The activity labels are in the y_test.txt file. The test subjects are in the subject_test.txt file.

The same holds for the training set.

About the script and the tidy dataset

A script created will run_analysis.R which will merge the test and training sets together. Prerequisites for this script:

the UCI HAR Dataset must be extracted and..
the UCI HAR Dataset must be availble in a directory called "UCI HAR Dataset"
After merging testing and training, labels are added and only columns that have to do with mean and standard deviation are kept.

Lastly, the script will create a tidy data set containing the means of all the columns per test subject and per activity. This tidy dataset will be written to a tab-delimited file called tidy.txt, which can also be found in this repository.

About the Code Book

The CodeBook.md file explains the transformations performed and the resulting data and variables.
